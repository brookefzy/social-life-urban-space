### 1.Pedetrian tracking from video
Click [here](https://github.com/brookefzy/uvi-yolov5-deepsort) to download the fine-tuned model weights and instructions for this projects.

### 2. Pedestrian group detection
Click [here](https://github.com/brookefzy/uvi-public-space) for grouping behavior detection after pedestrian detection results.


### 3. Replicate the analysis:
* Analysis Environment
```python=3.8, stataBE17```
* create a folder `_data` and save the data here first.

- 3.1 Figure 2: Lingering behavior and public space
- 3.2 Figure 3: Speed analysis
- 3.3 Figure 4: Group size analysis
- 3.4 Figure 5: Pedestrian churn rate and encounter

### 4. Replicate the supplemental materials
- Table S2: group size per frame summary
- Table S4: robustness test for spontenous encounter
- Table S5: pedestrian stay or alone by location
- Figure S4: pedestrian stay robustness analysis
